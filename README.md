**Summary:**
After testing my coffee app with 3 users via asking questions by Google forms, I found out that they were having difficulty in buttons and text visiblity and the navigation bar icons wasn't labeled. 
So I enhanced the color contrast as per suggestions and increased size of the buttons and text so it's easy to read and also labeled the icons in the navigation bar. 
All users found the new layout easier to use without any issues anymore.
